# Serendipity
## 1.1 Motivation behind this project
Travel planning is often stressful and time-consuming, with research showing that travelers visit an average of 38 websites before booking a vacation. Additionally, 57% of U.S. travelers believe that travel brands should tailor information to their preferences and experiences, a feature missing from many trip-planning platforms. To improve the travel experience, we created **Serendipity**, an AI-powered app that simplifies trip planning and offers personalized recommendations, making it easy for users to create their perfect travel plans.
## 1.2 Project Objective
The objective of the Serendipity project is to develop a comprehensive and user-friendly web-based
service that simplifies and personalizes the travel planning process. Leveraging the power of AI,
Serendipity will offer users a modern recommendation service integrated with planning tools to
personalize their travel itineraries according to their individual preferences, ultimately enhancing the
overall travel experience.
