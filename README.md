# Serendipity
## 1.1 Motivation behind this project
Travel planning can often be a stressful and time-consuming process. Extensive research
demonstrates that, on average, travelers visit approximately 38 websites before finalizing their
vacation bookings. Moreover, a noteworthy 57% of travelers in the United States firmly
believe that travel brands should customize their information to align with personal preferences
and past experiences. However, this particular feature remains largely unavailable in existing
trip-planning platforms. The task of trip planning can consume a significant amount of time,
compounded by the potential disruptions that may arise during a trip if alternative plans are not
promptly devised. These factors collectively contribute to a subpar travel experience for users.
To address these challenges, Serendipity is designed as an AI-powered application to provide a
comprehensive one-stop solution for trip planning and recommending. Serendipity empowers
users to curate their ideal travel plans with ease.
## 1.2 Project Objective
The objective of the Serendipity project is to develop a comprehensive and user-friendly web-based
service that simplifies and personalizes the travel planning process. Leveraging the power of AI,
Serendipity will offer users a modern recommendation service integrated with planning tools to
personalize their travel itineraries according to their individual preferences, ultimately enhancing the
overall travel experience.
